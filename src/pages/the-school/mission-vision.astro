                  Our mission is Education for All, so we promote a calm,
                  energising, and intellectually stimulating environment where
                  every student stands an equal chance to showcase their
                  talents. Every child is born with a unique potential & ability
                  and does not necessarily have to follow in the footsteps of
                  others. We need to support them as they cultivate and harness
                  the inherent strength they are blessed with.
                </p>
                <p class="">
                  We strengthen our mission through the following practices:

                  Delhi Public School, Ruby Park, Kolkata, is under the Om Dayal
                  Educational & Research Society, which constantly strives to
                  sustain the standards of excellence in all areas of
                  extra-curricular and curricular activities. Our moral
                  obligation and on-going work are to mould and shape future
                  generations to meet the challenges of the twenty-first
                  century. We envision a solid community of future leaders who
                  would be receptive to the winds of change and committed to
                  social responsibility while finding a delicate balance between
                  conventional values and contemporary ethos.

                <h1 class="text-2xl text-blue-600 font-bold py-2">Values</h1>

                <p class="">
                  We at DPS always try to instil values like honesty,
                  philanthropy, unity, sharing, and tolerance through various
                  activities conducted in School. Values have always remained an
                  integrated part of our curriculum, as our children start their
                  day with morning assemblies which include prayer followed by
                  thought for the day. Young absorbent minds are the best
                  recipients of these values as they are so pure, and values
                  inculcated in them at this early age would help them shape up
                  as ‘future-ready’ global citizens. Regular value education
                  classes are a part of the curriculum where children learn the
                  correct values by listening or enacting stories and
                  interacting with their teachers, who help them understand
                  values. Our constant guidance profoundly shapes these young
                  students’ minds during every stage of the learning process.
